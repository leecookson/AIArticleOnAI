How enhancing an article about AI tools with AI tools went

A journey through writing a post about AI Coding tools that took a left turn at ChatGPT when I asked it to "refine" my post.

Original, plain, detailed, very badly written post:
[Original](./AIToolsPaperRaw.md)

ChatGPT writing a whole other paper, but very nicely:
[ChatGPT Something Else](./AIToolsPaper-ModifiedByChatGPT.md)

Try again, ChatGPT, this time with more specific requirements:
[ChatGPT, I mean it this time](./AIToolsPaper-ChatGPTWithMuchClearerInstructions.md)

Generally Improved by Gemini:
[Gemini Update (with refinement)](./AIToolsPaper-GeminiRefinement.md)
